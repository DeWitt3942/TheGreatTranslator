00:00.000  --> 00:06.200
Do you want to rule?  Do you see the problems in your country and know how to fix them?<br>
00:06.240  --> 00:08.820
If only you had the power to do so.<br>
00:08.820  --> 00:10.860
Well, you've come to the right place.<br>
00:10.960  --> 00:18.480
But before we begin this lesson in political power, ask yourself why don't rulers see as clearly as you...<br>
00:18.480  --> 00:22.880
...instead acting in such, selfish, self-destructive, short-sighted ways?<br>
00:22.880  --> 00:26.520
Are they stupid… these most powerful people in the world?<br>
00:26.840  --> 00:28.440
Or is it something else?<br>
00:28.480  --> 00:32.720
The throne looks omnipotent from afar, but it is not as it seems.<br>
00:32.840  --> 00:37.120
Take the throne to act, and the throne acts upon you.<br>
00:37.200  --> 00:42.600
Accept that or turn back now before we discuss, the Rules for Rulers.<br>
00:42.640  --> 00:44.800
*somber music*<br>
00:44.800  --> 00:50.360
No matter how bright the rays of any sun king: No man rules alone.<br>
00:50.360  --> 00:56.800
A king can’t build roads alone, can’t enforce laws alone, can't defend the nation or himself, alone.<br>
00:56.840  --> 01:04.400
The power of a king is not to act, but to get others to act on his behalf, using the treasure in his vaults.<br>
01:04.400  --> 01:06.960
A king needs an army, and someone to run it.<br>
01:06.960  --> 01:08.720
Treasure and someone to collect it.<br>
01:08.840  --> 01:11.280
Law and someone to enforce it.<br>
01:11.280  --> 01:16.260
The individuals needed to make the necessary things happen are the king's keys to power.<br>
01:16.440  --> 01:24.520
All the changes you wish to make are but thoughts in your head if the keys will not follow your commands.<br>
01:24.640  --> 01:29.80
In a dictatorship, where might makes right, the number of keys to power is small, ...<br>
01:29.80  --> 01:33.520
...perhaps only a dozen generals, bureaucrats, and regional leaders.<br>
01:33.520  --> 01:37.240
Sway them to your side and the power to rule is yours, but...<br>
01:37.240  --> 01:40.820
...never forget: displease them and they will replace you.<br>
01:40.820  --> 01:48.399
Now all countries lie on a spectrum from those where the ruler needs few key supporters to those where the ruler needs many...<br>
01:48.640  --> 01:53.40
...this foundation of power is why countries are different.<br>
01:53.160  --> 01:56.399
Yet many keys or few, the rules are the same:<br>
01:56.520  --> 02:00.280
First, get the key supporters on your side.<br>
02:00.400  --> 02:06.840
With them, you have the power to act; you have everything.  Without them, you have nothing.<br>
02:07.000  --> 02:11.160
Now in order to keep those keys to power, you must, second:<br>
02:11.280  --> 02:13.200
Control the treasure.<br>
02:13.200  --> 02:17.920
You must make sure your treasure is raised and distributed to you -- for all your hard work<br>
02:17.920  --> 02:20.839
-- and to the keys needed to keep your position.<br>
02:21.120  --> 02:27.120
This is your true work as a ruler: figuring out how best to raise and distribute resources,<br>
02:27.240  --> 02:32.640
...so as not to topple the house of cards upon which your throne sits.<br>
02:32.640  --> 02:37.200
Now you, aspiring benevolent dictator, may want to help your citizens,...<br>
02:37.400  --> 02:43.720
...but your control of the treasure is what attracts rivals, so you must keep those keys loyal.<br>
02:43.720  --> 02:48.320
But there is only so much treasure in your vaults, so much wealth your kingdom produces.<br>
02:48.480  --> 02:54.880
So beware: every bit of treasure spent on citizens is treasure not spent on loyalty.<br>
02:54.880  --> 03:00.000
Thus, doing the right thing, spending the wealth of the nation on the citizens of the nation,...<br>
03:00.000  --> 03:03.440
...hands a tool of power acquisition to your rivals.<br>
03:03.520  --> 03:12.240
Treasure poured into roads, and universities, and hospitals, is treasure a rival can promise to key supporters if only they switch sides.<br>
03:12.480  --> 03:19.119
Benevolent dictators can spend their take on the citizens, but the keys must get their rewards,...<br>
03:19.120  --> 03:28.200
for *even if* you have gathered the most loyal, angelic supporters, they have the same problem as you, just one level down...<br>
03:28.280  --> 03:31.960
Being a key to power is a position of power.<br>
03:31.960  --> 03:41.240
They too must watch out for rivals from below or above: thus the treasure they get must also be spent to maintain their position.<br>
03:41.240  --> 03:44.760
The loyal and dim may stay by your side no matter what,...<br>
03:44.760  --> 03:55.239
...but smart key supporters, will always watch the balance of power, ready to change allegiance if you look to be the loser in a shifting web of alliances.<br>
03:55.280  --> 03:58.920
In countries where the keys are few, the rewards are great...<br>
03:59.40  --> 04:06.679
...and when violence rules, the most ruthless are attracted; and angels that build good works will lose to devils that don't.<br>
04:06.680  --> 04:14.440
So buy all the loyalty you can, because loyalty, in dictatorial organizations of all kinds, is everything.<br>
04:14.440  --> 04:16.279
For the ruler, anyway.<br>
04:16.279  --> 04:18.200
Thus, the dictatorship exposed:<br>
04:18.200  --> 04:24.400
A king who needs his court to raise the treasure to keep the court loyal and keep raising the treasure.<br>
04:24.400  --> 04:30.80
This is the self-sustaining core of power, all outside is secondary.<br>
04:30.80  --> 04:33.560
Now a king with many key supporters has real problems:<br>
04:33.560  --> 04:39.840
not just their expense, but also their competing needs and rivalries are difficult to balance,...<br>
04:39.840  --> 04:47.560
...the more complicated the social and financial web between them all, the more able a rival is to sway a critical mass.<br>
04:47.560  --> 04:52.520
The more key supporters a ruler has on average, the shorter their reign.<br>
04:52.520  --> 04:55.840
Which brings us to the third rule for rulers:<br>
04:55.840  --> 04:58.119
Minimize Key Supporters<br>
04:58.120  --> 05:04.480
If a key in your court becomes unnecessary, his skills no longer required, you must kick him out.<br>
05:04.480  --> 05:10.000
After a successful coup,  the new dictator will purge some of those who helped him come to power,...<br>
05:10.000  --> 05:16.480
... while working with the underlings of the previous dictator -- which from the outside seems a terrible idea.<br>
05:16.480  --> 05:19.240
Why abandon your fellow revolutionaries?<br>
05:19.240  --> 05:21.800
Are the old dictator's supporters not a danger?<br>
05:21.960  --> 05:27.159
But the keys necessary to gain power are not the same as those needed to keep it.<br>
05:27.160  --> 05:38.520
Having someone on the payroll who was vital in the past, but useless now is the same as spending money on the citizens: treasure wasted on the irrelevant.<br>
05:38.520  --> 05:45.400
And by definition, a dictator that pulls off a coup has promised greater treasure to those switching sides.<br>
05:45.400  --> 05:51.400
The size of the vault has not changed, so the treasure must be split among fewer.<br>
05:51.400  --> 06:00.719
A dictator that sways the right keys, takes control of the treasure, cuts unnecessary spending, kills unnecessary keys, will have a long and successful career.<br>
06:00.720  --> 06:08.520
Seeing the structure unveiled, you might be excited to get started and control a country to the benefit of you and your cronies,...<br>
06:08.520  --> 06:17.440
...or you might be exhausted, wishing to do good but seeing the structural difficulties, now turn to democracy for salvation.<br>
06:17.440  --> 06:20.840
So let us discuss rulers as representatives.<br>
06:22.160  --> 06:28.960
You again might have grand dreams of the utopia you wish to build, but: no man rules alone.<br>
06:28.960  --> 06:31.799
And never more so than in democracy.<br>
06:31.800  --> 06:36.800
Presidents and Prime ministers must negotiate with their senates and parliaments and vice versa.<br>
06:36.800  --> 06:40.440
And they all have their own key supporters to manage.<br>
06:40.440  --> 06:47.320
In a well-designed democracy, power is fractured among many, and is taken not with force but with words,…<br>
06:47.320  --> 06:53.159
… meaning you must get thousands or millions of citizens to if not like you on election day, …<br>
06:53.160  --> 06:56.120
…at least like you better than the alternative.<br>
06:56.120  --> 07:02.160
With so many voters and such fractured power it's impossible to, as a dictator would,…<br>
07:02.160  --> 07:05.560
…follow these rules and buy loyalty.  Or is it?<br>
07:05.600  --> 07:06.560
Of course not.<br>
07:06.560  --> 07:13.240
Don't think of citizens as individuals with their individual desires, but instead as divided into blocs:<br>
07:13.280  --> 07:19.520
…the elderly, or homeowners, or business owners, or the poor.  Blocs you can reward as a group.<br>
07:19.520  --> 07:25.760
Democracies have wildly complicated tax codes, and laws, not as accident but as reward<br>
07:25.760  --> 07:30.240
for the blocks that get and keep the ruling representatives in power:<br>
07:30.240  --> 07:35.280
Farming subsidies, for example, have nothing to do with the food a nation needs, ...<br>
07:35.280  --> 07:40.000
...but entirely with how key the vote of the farming bloc is.<br>
07:40.000  --> 07:45.400
Countries where farmers’ votes don't swing elections, don’t have farming subsidies.<br>
07:45.400  --> 07:50.919
If a bloc doesn’t vote, such as younger citizens, then no need to divert rewards their way.<br>
07:50.920  --> 07:55.200
Even if large in number, they are irrelevant to gaining power.<br>
07:55.200  --> 08:02.960
Which is good news for you: one less block to sway and the treasure you give to your key blocks has to come from somewhere...<br>
08:02.960  --> 08:10.120
If you want long years in office, rule three is your friend in a democracy just as much as a dictatorship.<br>
08:10.120  --> 08:15.200
You can't eliminate those who don’t vote for you, but there is still much you can do.<br>
08:15.280  --> 08:20.479
Once in power, make it easier for your key blocks to vote and harder for others.<br>
08:20.480  --> 08:25.800
Establish voting systems that reduce the number of blocs you need to win the more rivals you get,…<br>
08:25.800  --> 08:27.80
…very handy indeed.<br>
08:27.80  --> 08:31.520
Draw election borders to predetermine the results for you or your cronies, …<br>
08:31.520  --> 08:38.679
…and have party pre-elections with Byzantine rules to determine who blocs even *can* vote for.<br>
08:38.679  --> 08:42.880
Mix and match the above for even better power perpetuation.<br>
08:42.880  --> 08:47.400
When approval ratings couldn't be lower, yet re-election rates couldn't be higher,…<br>
08:47.400  --> 08:48.880
… you'll know you've succeeded.<br>
08:48.880  --> 08:51.760
Now, enough with thinking about the citizens.<br>
08:51.760  --> 08:58.240
Even in a democracy there still are very influential individual key supporters<br>
08:58.240  --> 09:05.360
...you need on your side because their money or influence or favors keeps you in power.<br>
09:05.360  --> 09:10.280
While you can’t just promise to give them treasure directly, as a dictator would,…<br>
09:10.280  --> 09:15.319
…you can create loopholes for their investments, pass laws that they’ve written, …<br>
09:15.320  --> 09:18.240
… or print get out of jail free cards for their actions.<br>
09:18.240  --> 09:22.640
Not a wheelbarrow of gold to the door, but contracts for their business.<br>
09:22.680  --> 09:28.599
You as ruler do have roads to build or computers to maintain or buildings to reconstruct.<br>
09:28.600  --> 09:31.40
No man rules alone, after all.<br>
09:31.40  --> 09:35.120
Or you could take the moral path, and ignore the big keys.<br>
09:35.120  --> 09:38.760
But you'll fight against those who didn't.  Good luck with that.<br>
09:38.760  --> 09:43.80
Corruption is not some kind of petty crime, but rather a tool of power, …<br>
09:43.80  --> 09:48.160
…in democracies and dictatorships, but more on that another time.<br>
09:48.160  --> 09:52.199
So, accept the favors, sway the key blocs and you will get into power, …<br>
09:52.200  --> 09:57.40
… ruling with actions that look contradictory and stupid to those who don't understand the game —<br>
09:57.40  --> 10:00.520
privately helping a powerful industry you publicly denounced, …<br>
10:00.520  --> 10:03.600
… or passing laws that hurt a bloc that voted for you.<br>
10:03.600  --> 10:08.40
But your job isn’t to have a consistent understandable ruling policy, …<br>
10:08.40  --> 10:13.000
… but to balance the interests of your keys to power, big and small.<br>
10:13.000  --> 10:14.960
That is how you stay in office.<br>
10:14.960  --> 10:18.200
Now with all this headache of being a representative, you may wonder,…<br>
10:18.200  --> 10:23.200
… looking at rule three why couldn’t you skip all this bloc-building, favor trading nonsense …<br>
10:23.240  --> 10:26.80
… and just bribe the army to take power?<br>
10:26.80  --> 10:29.600
We must finally turn to: taxes and revolts.<br>
10:29.680  --> 10:36.760
You must understand rule  two and how the treasure is raised and used to hold a country together.<br>
10:36.760  --> 10:41.800
If we graph the tax rate of countries vs the number of key supporters the ruler needs, …<br>
10:41.800  --> 10:46.359
… there’s a clear relationship.  More democracy, lower taxes.\<br>
10:46.360  --> 10:50.600
If you're sitting comfortably in a cushy democracy you may scoff at this, …<br>
10:50.600  --> 10:56.440
… but your fellow citizens who don’t earn enough don’t pay income taxes and get rebates, …<br>
10:56.440  --> 11:01.600
… bringing the *average* tax rate down.  In dictatorships, this doesn’t happen.<br>
11:01.600  --> 11:06.680
Dictatorships often forgo tax paperwork in favor of just taking wealth directly.<br>
11:06.680  --> 11:11.400
It’s common for the dictator to force farmers to sell their produce to him for little, …<br>
11:11.400  --> 11:14.120
… then turn around and sell it on the open market,<br>
11:14.120  --> 11:18.440
… pocketing the difference at an unthinkably high equivalent tax rate.<br>
11:18.440  --> 11:23.560
So taxes in democracies are low in comparison to dictatorships.<br>
11:23.560  --> 11:27.239
But why do representatives lower their take?<br>
11:27.240  --> 11:29.800
Well, cutting taxes is a crowd pleaser.<br>
11:29.800  --> 11:36.920
Dictators have no need to please the crowds and thus can take a large percentage from their poor citizens to pay key supporters.<br>
11:36.960  --> 11:41.440
But representatives in a democracy can take a smaller percentage …<br>
11:41.440  --> 11:43.920
from each to pay their key supporters, …<br>
11:43.960  --> 11:49.840
… because their educated, freer citizens are more productive than peasants.<br>
11:49.840  --> 11:53.880
For rulers in a democracy, the more productivity the better.<br>
11:53.880  --> 11:58.720
Which is why they build universities and hospitals and roads and grant freedoms, …<br>
11:58.720  --> 12:05.120
…not just out of the goodness of their hearts but because it increases citizen productiveness,…<br>
12:05.120  --> 12:13.120
… which increases treasure for the ruler and their key supporters, even when a lower percentage is taken.<br>
12:13.120  --> 12:16.360
Democracies are better places to live than dictatorships,…<br>
12:16.360  --> 12:19.240
… not because representatives are better people,…<br>
12:19.240  --> 12:25.960
… but because their needs *happen* to be aligned with a large portion of the population.<br>
12:25.960  --> 12:30.800
The things that make citizens more productive also make their lives better.<br>
12:30.800  --> 12:36.160
Representatives want everyone productive, so everyone gets highways.<br>
12:36.160  --> 12:41.79
The worst dictators are those whose incentives are aligned with the fewest citizens, …<br>
12:41.80  --> 12:44.40
… those who have the fewest keys to power.<br>
12:44.40  --> 12:48.160
This explains why the worst dictatorships have something in common.<br>
12:48.160  --> 12:50.920
Gold or oil or diamonds or similar.<br>
12:50.920  --> 12:57.479
If the wealth of a nation is mostly dug out of the ground: it’s a terrible place to live…<br>
12:57.480  --> 13:04.160
… because a gold mine can run with dying slaves, and still produce great treasure.<br>
13:04.160  --> 13:10.240
Oil is harder, but luckily foreign companies can extract and refine it without any citizen involvement.<br>
13:10.240  --> 13:18.720
With citizens outside this cycle, they can be ignored while the ruler is rewarded and the keys to power kept loyal.<br>
13:18.720  --> 13:23.120
Thus we live in a world where the best, smartest democracies are stable, …<br>
13:23.120  --> 13:29.320
…the worst, richest dictatorships are stable, and in between is a valley of revolution.<br>
13:29.320  --> 13:35.400
The resource-rich dictators build roads only from their ports to their resources and from their palace to the airport, …<br>
13:35.400  --> 13:40.480
… and the people stay quiet not because this is fine or even because they’re scared, …<br>
13:40.480  --> 13:47.840
… but because the cold truth is: starving, disconnected, illiterates don't make good revolutionaries.<br>
13:47.840  --> 13:57.280
Now a middling dictator without resources must, as mentioned before, take a large amount of wealth directly from his poor farmers and factory workers.<br>
13:57.280  --> 14:04.160
Thus two roads won't do, and so he must maintain some minimums of life for the citizens.<br>
14:04.160  --> 14:10.319
But keeping the work-force somewhat connected and somewhat educated and somewhat healthy …<br>
14:10.320  --> 14:13.280
… makes them more able to revolt.<br>
14:13.280  --> 14:19.560
Now understand: the romantic image of the people storming the gates and overthrowing their dictator is mostly a fantasy.<br>
14:19.560  --> 14:26.839
If you run a middling dictatorship, the people only storm the palace when the army *lets them* to remove you, …<br>
14:26.840  --> 14:31.720
… because you lost control over your keys and are being replaced.<br>
14:31.720  --> 14:39.840
This is why after 'popular revolts’ in middling dictatorships, the new ruler is often the same as the old, if not worse.<br>
14:39.840  --> 14:48.000
The people didn't replace the king, the court replaced the king, using the peoples' protest they let happen to do it.<br>
14:48.000  --> 14:52.400
The very things a benevolent dictator wants to build to cross this valley …<br>
14:52.400  --> 14:58.640
… take treasure away from the keys to power and make the citizens more able to revolt, …<br>
14:58.720  --> 15:04.640
… often ending in a stronger ruler less likely to build bridges and more loyal to his keys.<br>
15:04.640  --> 15:09.840
On the other side, the best democracies are stable not just because the large number of keys…<br>
15:09.840  --> 15:14.240
… and their competing desires makes dictatorial revolt near-impossible to organize, …<br>
15:14.240  --> 15:19.200
… but also because the revolt would destroy the very wealth it intended to capture.<br>
15:19.200  --> 15:22.80
The high productivity of the citizens.<br>
15:22.80  --> 15:30.200
Plus: those helping the would-be dictator in a democracy know he plans to cull key supporters once in power.<br>
15:30.200  --> 15:32.320
That’s what’s a coup is.<br>
15:32.320  --> 15:38.120
So potential key supporters must weigh the probability of surviving the cull and getting the rewards, …<br>
15:38.120  --> 15:43.320
… versus the risk of being on the outside of a dictatorship they helped create.<br>
15:43.320  --> 15:46.600
In a stable democracy, that’s a terrible gamble:<br>
15:46.600  --> 15:48.720
maybe you'll be incredibly wealthy, …<br>
15:48.720  --> 15:54.800
… but probably you'll be dead and have made the lives of everyone you know worse.  The math says no.<br>
15:54.920  --> 16:01.920
Being on the right side of a coup in a dictatorship means having the resources to get you and your family what the peasants lack.<br>
16:01.920  --> 16:08.199
Health care, education, quality of life — this is what make the competition for power so fierce.<br>
16:08.200  --> 16:12.320
But in a democracy most already have these things, so why risk it?<br>
16:12.320  --> 16:16.600
So the more the wealth of a nation comes from the productive citizens of the nation, …<br>
16:16.680  --> 16:23.680
… the more the power gets spread out and the more the ruler must maintain the quality of life for those citizens.<br>
16:23.680  --> 16:25.319
The less, the less.<br>
16:25.320  --> 16:29.240
Now if a stable democracy becomes very poor, …<br>
16:29.240  --> 16:33.840
… or if a resource that dwarfs the productivity of the citizens is found, …<br>
16:33.840  --> 16:40.720
… the odds of this gamble change, and make it more possible for a small group to seize power.<br>
16:40.720  --> 16:48.920
Because if the current quality of life is terrible or the wealth not dependent on the citizens, coups are worth the risk.<br>
16:48.920  --> 16:53.000
When democracies fall, these are usually the reasons.<br>
16:53.80  --> 16:54.960
*somber music*<br>
16:55.40  --> 17:00.839
These rules for rulers explain not only why some men are monsters and others are merciful, …<br>
17:00.840  --> 17:07.360
… but everything about politics: from war to foreign aid, to political dynasties, to corruption.<br>
17:07.359  --> 17:10.240
All of which, we can talk about at another time.<br>
17:10.240  --> 17:15.120
But for now, you aspiring ruler, may be disgusted by the world of politics, …<br>
17:15.119  --> 17:20.359
… and have decided to avoid it entirely, but you cannot, for rulers come in many forms.<br>
17:20.440  --> 17:26.520
Yes, Kings, Presidents and Prime Ministers but also Deans, Dons, Mayors, Chairs, Chiefs.<br>
17:26.520  --> 17:34.000
These rules apply to all and explain their actions: from the CEO of the largest global corporate conglomerate …<br>
17:34.000  --> 17:38.480
… who must keep his board happy, to the chair of the smallest home owner’s association, …<br>
17:38.480  --> 17:41.280
… managing votes and spending membership fees.<br>
17:41.280  --> 17:44.80
You cannot escape structures of power.<br>
17:44.80  --> 17:48.480
You can only turn a blind eye to understanding them, and …<br>
17:48.480  --> 17:53.960
… if you ever want the change you dream about, there is a zeroth rule you cannot ignore.<br>
17:53.960  --> 17:58.80
Without power you can affect nothing.<br>
17:58.120  --> 18:03.679
You may not like these rules, but surely, better you on the throne than someone else.<br>
18:03.680  --> 18:07.680
And who knows, maybe you’ll be different.<br>
18:07.680  --> 18:13.280
*somber piano music, slowly fading*<br>
18:13.280  --> 18:20.760
This video and its follow-ups are based largely on The Dictator’s Handbook by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alistair Smith, …<br>
18:20.760  --> 18:25.120

18:25.280  --> 18:32.80
There is far more detail and far more examples in it than I could ever hope to cover any series of videos.<br>
